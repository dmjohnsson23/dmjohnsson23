Are you wondering why I have an extra `s` in `johnson`? Continue wondering; it's a secret to 
everyone. As for the number 23, it's prime, and its digital sum is also prime. What, don't 
you have a favorite number?

I'm a software developer, a fan of puzzle games, a freedom-loving Linux enthusiast, and also 
just that weird guy who watches math videos on YouTue for fun. I'm also a bibliophile: in particular 
I like the works of Brandon Sanderson, and I'm a bit of a hobbyist writer myself.

I'm pretty handy with Python. I'm also proficient with SQL, Javascript, PHP, Dart, GraphQL, HTML, CSS, 
Docker, and other technologies. In addition, I'm interested in Rust, Ruby, and Go; though I don't have
experience with these yet. Overall, I feel like with a little time I can be productive with just about
any language, and don't consider myself married to any of them.

I live in the beautiful mountains of Utah, where I love, away from all the big cities. I prefer the
quiet humble life and working at small companies.
